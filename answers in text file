Q: Are there any data quality issues present? 

1. Missing/Incomplete Data in all Three Files (see query#1.1)
    • In the <Transaction file>, while most fields have no missing values, the Barcode field’s 11.52% null rate could still disrupt product tracking and reward allocation, 
    affecting Fetch’s data accuracy and personalized services. 

    • the <User file>, the Language field has a significant null rate of 30.51%, which is crucial for personalized services. There's also round 5% null rate for
    State, Language, and gender. (see query#1.2)
    
    • In the <Products file>, Category_4 has a critical 92.02% missing values, severely limiting detailed product categorization. 
    Missing data in Manufacturer and Brand (both at 26.78%) impacts Fetch’s ability to track product origins and brand performance. 
    Additionally, the Manufacturer field also placeholders (e.g., "PLACEHOLDER MANUFACTURER"), which indicates incomplete or unprocessed data. 
    The Barcode field (0.48% missing) is essential for linking products to transactions, and missing values risk disrupting transaction tracking and reward accuracy. (see query#1.3)


2. Linking Key Mismatch in all Three Files
    • Between <User File> and <Transaction file>: The query revealed a significant issue with linking the 2 tables using the USER_ID and ID keys. 
    Approximately 99.5% of records in the <Transaction file> failed to link to any corresponding user in the <User File>, which indicates a mismatch or absence of valid 
    user information for the majority of transactions. This is a critical data quality issue. (see query#2.1)

    • Between <Products file> and <Transaction file>: The query revealed that approximately 50.35% of the data in the <Transaction file> failed to link to the product_table based on the BARCODE key. 
    A substantial portion of transactions does not have a corresponding product entry. (see query#2.2)



3. In <Transaction file>
• Duplicate Data
    • Duplicate Transactions: The query identified 149 duplicate rows, where multiple records have identical values across all key columns such as 
    Receipt_id, Purchase_date, Scan_date, Store_name, User_id, Barcode, Final_quantity, and Final_sale. (see query#3)

• Inconsistent Data
    • Inconsistent Final Sale Values and Duplicate Transactions: The query identified 12,496 rows where all fields were identical except for Final_sale. (see query#4-5)
    • Inconsistent Barcode Lengths: The results showed that the Barcode field contained values with various lengths that deviated from the expected 12 or 13 characters, 
    and -1 indicated invalid or placeholder values. (see query#6)

• Data Integrity Issues
    • Mismatch Between Final Quantity and Final Sale: Among the 12,500 rows where the Final Quantity was zero, 12,341 rows had a non-zero Final Sale. (see query#7)
    • Mismatch Between Scan Date and Purchase Date: Scan Date was earlier than Purchase Date in 94 rows, suggesting potential fraud, manual manipulation, or system errors. (see query#8)

• Inaccurate Data Types
    • Data Type Inconsistency in Final Quantity: The query identified 12,500 rows where Final Quantity was stored as ‘zero’ (a string) instead of a numeric value.
     'zero' represents the second most common value for Final Quantity, emphasizing the scale and potential impact of this data inconsistency. (see query#9)


4. In <User File>
 • Inconsistent Data
    • Inconsistent Gender Field: Variations like "non_binary" vs. "Non-Binary" and different representations of "unknown" or similar terms created inconsistencies.
    • Synonyms/Multiple Representations: Different terms like "not_listed", "not_specified", "My gender isn't listed", and "unknown" may refer to the same or similar concepts, 
    but they are stored as distinct values.    

 • Incorrect Data
    • Unusual Difference Between Birth Date and Created Date: The query identified 62 rows where the calculated age from the Birth Date exceeded 100 years, 
    indicating very elderly individuals who were unlikely to have a recent record creation. (see query#10)
    • Created Date Before Birth Date: There was one row where the Created Date occurred before the Birth Date, which was logically impossible. (see query#11)
    • Unreliable Data of Birth Date Field: The inclusion of a time component (00:00:00.000 Z) introduces potentially inaccurate information. Since most people don’t remember 
    or share their exact birth time, this could indicate default system values, incorrect data entry, or even fake data. 

 • Inaccurate Data format
    • Inconsistent Birth Date Field: a time component (00:00:00.000 Z) is included, but since only the date is relevant for this field, the inclusion of the time part 
    introduces inconsistency in how birth dates are stored. To standardize the data, it would be better to store just the date (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD) across all records.


6. In <Products File>
• Duplicate Data
    • Duplicate Barcode: The query identified multiple rows with the same Barcode, indicating potential duplicate product entries in the system.   
    Specifically, the same Barcode is associated with 2 different Brands. (see query#12)

• Inconsistent Data
    • Same Brand Under Different Manufacturers: Brands like CHAPSTICK, LE PETIT MARSEILIAIS, and TYGAZ appeared under more than one manufacturer, 
    This could indicate legitimate reasons like licensing or co-manufacturing, but it may also point to data entry errors or inconsistencies. 
    Further investigation is needed to confirm if this is accurate or a data issue. (see query#13)
    • Inconsistent Barcode Lengths: The results showed that the Barcode field contained values with various lengths that deviated from the expected 12 or 13 characters. (see query#14)  
    
 


Q: Are there any fields that are challenging to understand?

1. The FINAL_QUANTITY field in <Transaction file> is unclear, especially with values like 4.55. It's ambiguous whether it represents weight, units, or something else. 
Additionally, without a clear relationship to FINAL_SALE, it’s hard to understand if the price reflects a per-weight cost or unit cost, which creates uncertainty in interpretation.

2. Language Code (es-419) in <User File>: The es-419 language might not be immediately clear to all users. 

3. Time Zone Representation in <User File>: The Z at the end of the Birth Date and Created Date fields might not be fully understood by everyone.

4. The entry "MAPLE HOLISTICS AND HONEYDEW PRODUCTS INTERCHANGEABLY" in the Manufacturer field in <Products File> is unclear, 
as it ambiguously references either one entity with two interchangeable names or two distinct entities. 




Q: What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned among users 21 and over? (see query#15)

-> Key assumptions: Assume we only valid/cleaned data (user, transactions, product)

BRAND	         receipt_count
---------------  ---------------
NERDS CANDY	  3
DOVE	          3
TRIDENT	          2
SOUR PATCH KIDS	  2
HERSHEY'S	  2





Q: What are the top 5 brands by sales among users that have had their account for at least six months? (see query#16)

-> Key assumptions: Assume 6 months = 180 days

BRAND	       total_sales
----------     ---------------
CVS	        72
DOVE	        30.91
TRIDENT	        23.36
COORS LIGHT	17.48
TRESEMMÉ	14.58





Q: Who are Fetch’s power users? (see query#17)

-> Key assumptions: 
 • Define Power Users as those with total spending >= 20 or at least 2 receipts or at least 2 items;
    • This is because the 80th percentile of the sum_spending_per_user is approximately 19.35, so I make it 20 for simplicity;
    • And I want to focus on users who are actively engaged and not just first-time buyers.

Summary in short: Fetch's power users are middle-aged to older women, who predominantly speak English and reside in states like North Carolina, Illinois, and Wisconsin. 

Observations based on query result: 
1. Dominance by Gender: 
The majority of power users are female across all age groups and states. 
Only a few males appear in the data.

2. Age Distribution:
The 36-50 age group has the highest representation across different states.
The 50+ age group also shows significant participation, indicating strong engagement from middle-aged and older users.
Younger age groups, particularly under 18, are entirely absent.

3. Language Preference:
Most power users speak English (en), with only a few Spanish-speaking users (es-419). 

4. State Representation:
North Carolina (NC), Illinois (IL), and Wisconsin (WI) have multiple power users.
Other states, like California (CA) and Florida (FL), have a mix of engaged users, but they are not as prominent as expected given their larger populations.

5. High-Spending Outliers::
A user in New York (NY) aged 50+ spent significantly more than others, with an average of $26.14 per receipt.
A user in Pennsylvania (PA) (male, 50+) is a major outlier with $75.99 in average spending.

Hi XXX,

I wanted to share an update on two important topics that are critical for our product and business strategies: the Power Users analysis and a recent data quality review.

>> Power Users Analysis Insights: I completed an analysis of power users based on their spending, receipts, and items, grouped by age, gender, language, and state. 
Here are the key insights:
1. Female Users are Highly Engaged: Across all age groups, females are the most active, especially in the 26-50 range. 
This could inform our product and promotional strategies.

2. Older Demographics are High-Spending: Users aged 50+ show higher spending, particularly in states like Pennsylvania. 
This could present an opportunity for targeted rewards or campaigns.


>> What I Need to Proceed:
- Clarification on Target Groups: Do we have any specific business goals around targeting certain 
demographics (e.g., gender, age group)? This would help refine our analysis and make it more actionable.

- State-Level Strategy: There’s a noticeable concentration of power users in certain states like North Carolina, Illinois, 
and Florida. Do we have any ongoing regional marketing efforts or campaigns? Understanding this could guide us in suggesting 
regional product tweaks or localized rewards.


>> Data Quality Review Summary: During a recent data quality review, I identified several issues that could impact product tracking, 
reward accuracy, and personalized services. Here’s a quick breakdown:
1. Missing Data:
    - Barcode values missing in Transactions (11.5%) and Products File (0.5%), impacting tracking and linking.
    - Critical fields like Language (30%) in Users and Category_4 (92%) in Products File are incomplete.

2. Inconsistencies:
    - Duplicate and mismatched transactions, including rows where Final Quantity is zero but Final Sale is non-zero.
    - Some dates and barcode lengths are inconsistent or invalid.

3. Linking Key Mismatch across Data Files:
    - Approximately 99.5% of transactions fail to link to users, and 50.35% fail to link to products due to mismatched or missing keys.
        - This severely impacts our ability to track user activity, associate transactions with products, and derive insights for product performance.

4. Standardization Issues:  
    - Variations in Gender field values (e.g., "Non-Binary" vs. "non_binary") and unnecessary time components in Birth Date complicate reporting.

5. Integrity Concerns:
    - Implausible ages (>100 years) in Users and duplicate Barcodes linked to different brands in Products file.

I believe addressing these issues will provide us with a more accurate, reliable data set and ultimately improve our product offerings and business operations.
Any priorities you have regarding the resolution of these data quality issues—whether it's addressing the most critical fields first or a broader data cleanup effort.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Thanks,
Cathy
